Markdown Extra
--------------

**StackEdit** supports **Markdown Extra**, which extends **Markdown** syntax with some nice features.

> **Tip:** You can disable any **Markdown Extra** feature in the `Extensions` tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> `Settings` dialog.


### Tables

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for tables:

Item      | Value
--------- | -----
Computer  | 1600 USD
Phone     | 12 USD
Pipe      | 1 USD

You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:

| Item      |    Value | Qty  |
| :-------- | --------:| :--: |
| Computer  | 1600 USD |  5   |
| Phone     |   12 USD |  12  |
| Pipe      |    1 USD | 234  |


### Definition Lists

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for definition lists too:

Term 1
Term 2
:   Definition A
:   Definition B

Term 3

:   Definition C

:   Definition D

	> part of definition D


### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks[^gfm] are also supported with **Prettify** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Highlight.js** instead of **Prettify**, just configure the `Markdown Extra` extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> `Settings` dialog.


### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

  [^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.


### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                                    | HTML                                |
 ------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`                      | &#8216;Isn&#8217;t this fun?&#8217; |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`                      | &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this fun?&#8221; |
| Dashes           | `-- is an en-dash and --- is an em-dash` | &#8211; is an en-dash and &#8212; is an em-dash |


### Table of contents

You can insert a table of contents using the marker `[TOC]`:

[TOC]


### Comments

Usually, comments in Markdown are just standard HTML comments. <!-- like this -->
**StackEdit** extends HTML comments in order to produce useful, highlighted comments in the preview but not in your exported documents. <!--- This is very useful for collecting feedback in a collaborative document. -->


### MathJax
 
You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**, as on [math.stackexchange.com][1]:

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall
n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> **Tip:** Make sure you include MathJax into your publications to render mathematical expression correctly. Your page/template should include something like: 

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://stackedit.io/libs/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
```
